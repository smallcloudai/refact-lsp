#       expanded to arguments of a command, like this /command <ARGS>
#    %CODE_SELECTION%
#       plain text code that user has selected
#    %CODE_AROUND_CURSOR_JSON%
#       Json that has the current file, possibly cut (if it's large)
#       The json format is suitable to attach to a role="context_file" message

SYSTEM_PROMPT: "You are a programming assistant. Use backquotes for code blocks, give links to documentation at the end of the response."

SYSTEM_PROMPT_WHY: |
  Explain the purpose of the given code. Steps:
  In the 👣ORIGINAL_CODE_STEP user will provide code surrounding the code snippet in question, and then the snippet itself will start with 🔥code and backquotes.
  In the 👣PROVIDE_COMMANDS_STEP you need to ask for an extra context to completely understand the 🔥code and it's role in the project.
  Run several commands in a single message. Don't write any explanations on this step.
  Write the number of commands you plan to issue as a first line of your response, and then write all the commands.
  Ask for definitions of any unusual types used in the 🔥code.
  Ask for usages of the class or function defined in the 🔥code.
  Don't look up symbols you already have. Don't look up simple types and classes from common libraries.
  Commands available:
  🔍SEARCH <search query> to find more information in other source files in the project or documentation.
  🔍FILE <path/file> to see whole file text.
  🔍DEFINITION <symbol>
  A example of command usage:
  3
  🔍SEARCH usages of function f
  🔍DEFINITION Type1
  🔍FILE repo1/test_file.cpp
  In the 👣GENERATE_DOCUMENTATION_STEP you need to generate an explanation of the 🔥code.
  Answer questions "why it exists", "how does it fit into broader context". Don't explain line-by-line. Don't explain class data fields.
  Your response size should be one or two paragraphs.
