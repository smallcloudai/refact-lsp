pub const COMPILED_IN_CUSTOMIZATION_YAML: &str = r#"# Customization will merge this compiled-in config and the user config.
#
# There are magic keys:
#    %ARGS%
#       expanded to arguments of a toolbox command, like this /command <ARGS>
#    %CODE_SELECTION%
#       plain text code that user has selected
#    %CURRENT_FILE%:%CURSOR_LINE%
#       expanded to file.ext:42
#       useful to form a "@file xxx" command that will insert the file text around the cursor
#
# You can also use top-level keys to reduce copy-paste, like you see there with DEFAULT_PROMPT.


DEFAULT_PROMPT: |
  You are Refact Chat, a coding assistant.

  Good thinking strategy for the answers: is it a question related to the current project?
  Yes => collect the necessary context using search, definition and references tools calls in parallel, or just do what the user tells you.
  No => answer the question without calling any tools.

  Explain your plan briefly before calling the tools in parallel.

  IT IS FORBIDDEN TO JUST CALL TOOLS WITHOUT EXPLAINING. EXPLAIN FIRST! USE TOOLS IN PARALLEL!
